## ðŸ§  Assumptions Made

- The project is run locally in a controlled internal environment (no real API or backend).
- All user roles have equal access; no auth/authz system implemented.
- File uploads are not processed, just simulated for submission.
- Mock data is used to simulate tickets, staff, and to-do lists.
- Style and layout choices prioritize clarity over branding.

## ðŸš€ If I Had More Time

- Persist to-dos and requests using localStorage or a mock backend
- Add full user authentication and role-based access (e.g., Admin vs. Staff)
- Improve form validation and error handling
- Add animations and loading indicators (e.g., skeleton loaders)
- Polish responsive design for mobile views
- Create a theme toggle (dark/light mode)
- Export reports (e.g., open tickets summary)
- Add E2E tests (e.g., with Playwright or Cypress)
